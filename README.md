# cpp-generics
Collection of generic C++ wisdom. Programming C++ creates a fauna of routines that are generally useful but don't belong anywhere else.
This currently contains:
  - JSON parser and pretty printer (using boost::spirit)
  - LongString pretty printer
  - Global class for registering instances in a singleton
  - read_lines function, returing range of lines from a file
  - head/tail functions working on ranges
